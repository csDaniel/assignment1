CS290 Biography

Name: 
Daniel OFarrell

Hobbies: 
I enjoy baking as a hobby. I realized back in university that it was a relaxing hobby that 
would just engross me deeply. When I was making bread, I realized that nothing else really
bothered me and I could just focus on the task at hand. It was like a mental vacation. I
know it sounds to strange to have baking as a hobby, but I find it rewarding.

Interests:
Usually on the weekends I'll be out exploring the city with friends, or hiking. Hiking can 
be very difficult, but when you're up on the mountain, it's the views that make it worth it.

Pets:
I have no pets save for some house plants. But, I don't think they count as pets for most 
people.
