CS290 Biography

Name: 
Daniel OFarrell

Hobbies: 
I enjoy baking as a hobby. I realized back in university that it was a relaxing hobby that 
would just engross me deeply. When I was making bread, I realized that nothing else really
bothered me and I could just focus on the task at hand. It was like a mental vacation. I
know it sounds to strange to have baking as a hobby, but I find it rewarding.

Interests:
Usually on the weekends I'll be out exploring the city with friends, or hiking. Hiking can 
be very difficult, but when you're up on the mountain, it's the views that make it worth it.
My other interests involve learning foreign languages and trying new restaurants.

Pets:
I have no pets save for some house plants. But, I don't think they count as pets for most 
people. 

Programming Background:
Prior to OSU, most of my experience had been with simple things, such as writing macros. In
high school, I studied visualBASIC. Thanks to OSU, I can now say I have experience working
with C and C++. 

In cs161, for my final project, I opted to make a dungeon crawler. It used a 2d array to draw
the contents of the map. The map was hand-made first on graph paper, then manually keyed in.
The character would move by the user entering in single key directions. Occasionally, there
would be a random battle being spawned. In total, the project took over a week and maybe 30-40
hours of programming.


For cs162, the final project called for an adventure game, with keyed in items that the user
was supposed to type in pointed questions and eventually collect enough items to step through
and beat the game. I was more intent on evolving my cs161 assignment. I used to basic idea of
pointers and linked lists to create my cs161 project, but on a multi-level system. I used .txt
files to store individual levels, which would then be loaded into 2d arrays of linked lists. 
The arrays would then be pointed to and the user would change maps, allowing a more true 
dungeon crawler experience. However, this was not the required assignment, and I lost 100% of 
the points for that section, resulting in a lower grade than I would have preferred.
